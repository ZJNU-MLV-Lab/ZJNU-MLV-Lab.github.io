      Machine Learning and Vision Lab at Zhejiang Normal University
    </p>
    <p>
      MLV Lab in the College of Mathematics and Computer Science at Zhejiang Normal University, is led by Professor <a href='http://mypage.zjnu.edu.cn/ZZL4/zh_CN/index.htm'>Zhonglong Zheng</a>.
      Zhonglong Zheng is a Ph.D supervisor, young and middle-aged academic leaders in Zhejiang Province, vice chairman of the fifth council of the National Higher Normal School Computer Education Research Association, and vice chairman of the Zhejiang University Computer Research Association.
      In 2005, he graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a Ph.D. He visited the University of California for one year (funded by CSC) from January 2012 to February 2013, and the co-supervisor is Professor <a href='https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/'>Ming-Hsuan Yang</a>, IEEE Fellow.

      We study machine learning, deep learning, pattern recognition, image processing and computer vision.
      The objective of our group is to learn general visual representation with neural networks, making the machine perceive and understand objects, scene and motion.
      Importantly, we have developed efficient and scalable solutions to handle real-world visual data on a large scale as well as in resource-limited environments.
      We have been actively publishing at related top conferences (e.g AAAI, ICDE, ACM MM, INFOCOM etc.) and journals (e.g IEEE T-CYB, IEEE T-MM, IEEE IOTJ, Pattern Recognition, Neurocomputing, Information Science, Science China, 计算机学报, 自动化学报 etc.).
